# Lem Webpage

This repository contains the code for the webpage of the Lem project and is currently hosted [here](https://lem-project.github.io/)


## Requirements

- [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)


## Development

This webpage uses the Hugo page system with a modify version of the theme [hugo-geekdoc](https://github.com/thegeeklab/hugo-geekdoc).

That theme is NOT in use, it's modified, so you don't have to clone it, it's already in the repository.

### Run

To run the server, go to the root directoy and run the command:
```
make server
```

If you want to just build the application run the command:

```
make build
```
